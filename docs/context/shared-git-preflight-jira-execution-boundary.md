# Architecture Clarification: Shared Git Preflight and Jira Execution Boundary

**Status:** Accepted architecture clarification
**Date:** 2026-07-28
**Scope:** Future implementation boundaries only. No runtime, hook, Connector,
installer, or telemetry behavior is changed by this document.

This clarification records the implementation boundary for the product decision in
[Jira-driven Work Lifecycle](jira-driven-work-lifecycle.md) without changing
the current Public V1 `work-start` behavior.

## Existing `work-start` boundary remains intact

`work-start` continues to:

```text
create Candidate -> stop at Human Review
```

It does not choose execution, create a working branch, or run `jira-work`.
Conversely, `jira-work` must not directly invoke the `work-start` runtime.
These are different product boundaries: `work-start` gathers reviewable context
candidates, while `jira-work` executes an already-approved Ticket Contract.

## Shared `git-work-preflight` contract

Future implementation may extract a shared `git-work-preflight` capability.
Both `work-start` and `jira-work` consume its read-only preflight contract;
they retain their distinct runtime and stop boundaries.

The contract reports, at minimum:

| Check | Required conclusion |
|---|---|
| Repository | Target repository identity and whether it matches the Ticket Contract. |
| Remote | Configured remote identity and reachable/ref-resolvable state. |
| Base Branch | Required base branch and its resolvability. |
| Local and remote HEAD | Actual revisions used to detect stale or divergent state. |
| Working Tree | Clean, dirty, staged, untracked, and conflicting state. |
| Existing Branch | Whether the expected branch exists locally or remotely and is safe to resume. |
| Existing PR | Whether a PR already exists for the branch/Ticket and its state. |
| Divergence | Ahead/behind/diverged conditions between relevant refs. |
| Do Not Touch | Contract prohibitions that make a proposed mutation unsafe. |
| Prohibited Git mutation | A direct declaration of any mutation the current gate forbids. |

The preflight is a gate, not a repair tool. It must surface a dirty tree,
diverged branch, unexpected remote, duplicate PR, or `Do Not Touch` conflict;
it must not reset, stash, clean, force-push, rebase, delete branches, or
silently select another Ticket or branch. A failure remains evidence for human
review.

Extracting this common contract must not change `work-start`'s external
behavior: it still creates a Candidate and ends at Human Review. Function
names, files, language choice, data shape, and call graph are deliberately
deferred to an implementation design after the pure contracts and fixtures
exist.

## `jira-work` gate and mutation boundary

Before any branch creation, `jira-work` must establish all of the following:

```text
existing Ticket Contract
-> canonical source agreement
-> no blocking sentinel
-> Connector available
-> shared Git preflight passed
-> Execution Policy permits the next action
```

V1 has no Connector-less degraded path: absent Connector means no Git mutation,
even where local Git checks could otherwise run. The Connector must obtain its
configuration at runtime or approved environment configuration; credentials,
Cloud ID, project key, and account ID are never embedded in the skill.

After a permitted mutation begins, the workflow may use a draft-PR provider
behind an abstraction boundary. `gh` is acceptable for an initial provider,
but provider selection and its authentication/error semantics must be verified
in the future implementation architecture. Draft-only is part of the boundary;
removing the draft state, merge, release, tag, production deployment,
migration, and secret changes stay outside it.

## Evidence and recovery boundary

Every external mutation is independently observable and can partially succeed.
Therefore future runtime behavior records actual state after each stage rather
than assuming an all-or-nothing transaction:

```text
Git branch / commit / push
  -> draft PR
  -> append-only Jira evidence comment
  -> permitted review transition
```

Retry begins by re-querying Ticket, branch, remote, PR, and Jira state. No
automatic rollback is issued. A successful PR with a failed Jira comment stays
open; a successful push with failed PR creation leaves the remote branch. A
review transition is attempted only after the append-only evidence comment has
succeeded. Required verification failures preserve changed work and report the
commands, failure evidence, and recovery action, while prohibiting commit,
push, and draft PR.

## Telemetry is a separate defect

Plugin-qualified skill names include `:`, but the current `harness-event`
validation regular expression rejects that character. This is not part of Jira
Lifecycle implementation. It is a minimal, independent bug fix with these
constraints:

- retain existing validation intent and fail-open behavior;
- extend only the telemetry fixture needed to prove qualified skill names; and
- do not add a `jira-work` step-level telemetry schema in this scope.

## Approved implementation sequence

| PR | Purpose | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| PR 0 | Fix the telemetry `:` validation bug and its fixture. | None; intentionally independent. |
| PR 1 | Record this Product Decision and Architecture Clarification. | Accepted design input; independent of PR 0. |
| PR 2 | Add `jira-ticket` pure contract, preview, and fixture. | PR 1. |
| PR 3 | Add `jira-work` pure contract, Ticket gate, and fixture. | PR 1 and the shared Ticket Contract from PR 2. |
| PR 4 | Extract shared `git-work-preflight`. | PR 3; retain the existing `work-start` stop boundary. |
| PR 5 | Add `jira-work` local Git mutation lifecycle. | PR 3 and PR 4. |
| PR 6 | Add `jira-ticket` Atlassian write integration. | PR 2. |
| PR 7 | Add `jira-work` Atlassian comment and transition integration. | PR 5 and PR 6. |
| PR 8 | Decide optional installation, README, and full E2E coverage. | PR 0 through PR 7. |

PR 8 is the first point at which installation instructions can be selected.
Until then, no installer or README feature claim is authorized.

## Open decisions retained for later PRs

- Ticket-level verification exception format.
- Optional-skill installation path: manual guidance, generic installer, or
  Jira-specific opt-in installer.
- Draft PR provider selection and provider-specific recovery semantics.
- Exact `git-work-preflight` module/files/language and how it is consumed
  without changing `work-start`'s public behavior.
- Jira field mapping, allowed transitions, and permission/error handling after
  Connector capability is verified.
